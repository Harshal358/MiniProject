# GLCD Logo Display with Custom Character Generation (ARM 7 LPC2138)

## Description

This project demonstrates the display of a custom logo (DIEMS logo in this example) on a Graphic LCD (GLCD) using an ARM 7 LPC2138 microcontroller. It includes code for generating custom characters and displaying them on the GLCD.

## Key Features

Custom character generation for GLCD display
Optimized for ARM 7 LPC2138 microcontroller
Includes complete project report for reference

## Getting Started

Hardware Requirements:

- ARM 7 LPC2138 microcontroller
- Graphic LCD (GLCD) compatible with the microcontroller
- Necessary connecting wires and breadboard
Software Requirements:

Keil uVision IDE (or any compatible IDE for ARM development)
Compiler and linker for ARM 7 LPC2138
Steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your IDE.
- Configure the project settings according to your hardware setup.
- Compile and build the project.
- Program the microcontroller with the compiled code.
- 
## Usage

- Create your own custom character bitmap arrays in the code.
- Modify the code to display your desired logo or characters.
- Run the code on your microcontroller to see the results on the GLCD.
